        <p>
          Thanks for registering your service. As this is the <strong>test federation</strong> it has been
          <strong>AUTOMATICALLY APPROVED</strong> and can be accessed by users from institutions in the Tuakiri-TEST federation.
        </p>

        <h4>UNIQUE URL</h4>
        <p>The unique URL which your application should direct users to in order to start the authentication process is:</p>

        <div class="alert alert-warning">
          <strong>https://<%= settings.hostname %>/jwt/authnrequest/research/<%= @identifier %></strong>
        </div>

        <p>Or, if your service needs custom JWT structure (Freshdesk, Zendesk),
        or the service needs additional Research and Education attributes (auEduPersonSharedToken),
        please contact the <a href="mailto:tuakiri@reannz.co.nz">Tuakiri Support Desk</a> - and after your
        service registration is adjusted, you will be provided with a different URL to use.

        <h2>Service Registration Complete</h2>

        <p>Thanks for registering your service. The Tuakiri team will review it and give final approval.</p>
        <p>Once approved, Tuakiri will <strong>email you</strong> at <em><%= session[:subject][:mail] %></em> with a unique URL to allow your service to connect to Tuakiri Rapid Connect.</p>
      </div>

      <p>If it has been more than 2 business days since you registered your service please contact <a href="mailto:tuakiri@reannz.co.nz?subject=Rapid Connect Registration Query">tuakiri@reannz.co.nz</a> for a progress update.</p>
